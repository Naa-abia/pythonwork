# Python abstract class example
# Suppose that you need to develop a payroll program for a company. The company has two groups of employees: full-time employees and hourly employees. The full-time employees get a fixed salary while the hourly employees get paid by hourly wages for their services.
# The payroll program needs to print out a payroll that includes employee names and their monthly salaries.To model the payroll program in an object-oriented way, you may come up with the following classes: Employee, FulltimeEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and Payroll.
# To structure the program, weâ€™ll use modules, where each class is placed in a separate module (or file).


# TO-DO
# they have two categories of employees and they are full time and part-time .
#  Fulltime gets a fixed rate and partime get hourly payment .
# the payroll must come up with Employee, fulltime , hourly , payroll

# Writing the employee as a base class and its going to be an abstract class who is going to be used


class Employee():
    id = 0
    first_name = ""
    last_name = ""
    role = ""
    is_active = True
    salary = 0
    # is active = if the employee is working or not


class FulltimeEmployee(Employee, Payroll):
   def print_payroll(self): 
    self.salary = 1000

    print(f"Employee Full Name: {self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
    print(f"Net Salary: {self.salary}")



class HourlyEmployee(Employee, Payroll):
    number_of_hours_worked = 0 
    HourlyEmployee_rate = 0
    def print_payroll(self):
        self.salary = self.number_of_hours_worked * self.HourlyEmployee_rate

        print(f"Employee Name: {self.first_name}{self.last_name}")
        print(f"Net Salary: {self.salary}")


# its inheriting from the Employee class because they will both be attributes of the employee.
# Bring the properties into the new classes through inheritance.
